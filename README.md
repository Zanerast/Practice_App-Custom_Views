# Practice App - Custom Views

## Project Overview
Course from [Caster.io](https://caster.io/courses/custom-views-viewgroups) - Custom Views and ViewGroups

The app, Custom Views, uses a custom timer view that counts up and a custom viewgroup to populate a RecyclerView.



## Why this Project?
To learn how how Android Views and ViewGroups are rendered. And to create custom views.



## This app does the following:
- Creates a custom ViewGroup by extending the base, and having specific children

- Uses a custom View class in an XML layout

- Requests a custom View class to redraw

![Alt text](viewgroup_one.png?raw=true "ViewGroup Image One") 
![Alt text](viewgroup_two.png?raw=true "ViewGroup Image Two") 
![Alt text](viewgroup_three.png?raw=true "ViewGroup Image Three")
